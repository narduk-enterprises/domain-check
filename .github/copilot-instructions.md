# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Read `AGENTS.md` at the project root for the full project rules and conventions.

## Repo skills

The committed GitHub-facing skill mirror lives in `.github/skills/`.
`~/.agents/skills/` is the canonical local source; refresh the repo mirror with
`pnpm run sync:github-skills` when local skills change. Generated starters ship
the committed `.github/skills/` copy and do not reach into workstation-local
paths directly.

## Architecture

- **PNPM Workspace**: The main application lives in `apps/web/`.
- **Shared Layer**: `layers/narduk-nuxt-layer/` provides standard modules,
  security middleware, and styling. Do not recreate what the layer already
  provides.
- **Examples**: Full-featured reference apps live in the companion
  `narduk-nuxt-template-examples` repository. This repo keeps only the shipped
  app plus shared infrastructure.

## Key Rules

- **Environment**: Nuxt 4 + Nuxt UI 4 deployed to Cloudflare Workers using D1
  and Drizzle ORM.
- **No Node.js in server code**: Worker routes cannot use `fs`, `path`, or Node
  `crypto`.
- **Data Fetching**: Use `useAsyncData` or `useFetch`, never raw `$fetch` in
  page `script setup`.
- **State Management**: Use `useState()` or Pinia. Never create bare module
  scope refs.
- **SEO**: Every page must call `useSeo()` and a Schema.org helper.
- **Pattern**: Thin components, thick composables.

## Build And Quality

1. Run `pnpm run build:plugins` after shared ESLint plugin changes.
2. Run `pnpm run quality` for the workspace quality gate.
3. Run `pnpm test:e2e` for the shipped app Playwright suite when needed.

## Bootstrap

- Start from a provisioned repo or generated starter checkout, then run
  `pnpm install`.
- Use Doppler for secrets. Do not add `.env` files.
